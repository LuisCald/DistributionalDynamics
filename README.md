# **Distributional Dynamics Data Repository**

This repository accompanies the paper *"Distributional Dynamics"* by Christian Bayer, Luis Calderon, and Moritz Kuhn (2024), where we introduce a novel method for generating high-frequency synthetic distributional data using functional time-series analysis and Bayesian state-space modeling.

## **About the Project**
Modern macroeconomic theories emphasize the critical role of distributional dynamics in understanding aggregate fluctuations, monetary and fiscal policy impacts, and socio-economic inequality. However, the limited availability of high-frequency joint distribution data has constrained research in this area. To address this gap, we developed a method that combines multiple microdata sources with aggregate data to estimate high-frequency synthetic joint distributions of consumption, income, and wealth.

This repository provides:
- High-frequency synthetic data derived from our model. We provide the model-implied PSID estimates.

## **Applications**
This repository supports research in:
- Macroeconomic modeling with heterogeneous agents.
- Distributional effects of economic policies.
- Business cycle analysis and inequality studies.
